# Code::Blocks Installation Guide (Website)

This is the source code for the **Code::Blocks version 25.03** (with MinGW) installation guide website, designed for C++ beginners.

This project is structured into 3 separate files (HTML, CSS, JS) for better management, easy editing, and learning basic web structure.

## 📂 Project Structure

To ensure the website works correctly, please make sure you have all 3 files in the same directory:

1.  **`HuongDanCaiDatCodeBlocks.html`**: The main file containing content, website structure, and libraries (Tailwind CSS, FontAwesome).
2.  **`style.css`**: Contains custom UI styling (scrollbar, effects, dark mode).
3.  **`script.js`**: Contains logic (dark mode, progress bar, copy code, auto table of contents).

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  Download all 3 files to your computer.
2.  Save them in the **same folder** (e.g., `CodeBlocksGuide`).
3.  Double-click **`HuongDanCaiDatCodeBlocks.html`** to open it in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, etc.).

## ✨ Key Features

* **Modern Interface**: Clean and readable design using Tailwind CSS.
* **Dark Mode**: Automatically detects system settings or can be manually toggled, helping to reduce eye strain.
